# Project-Battleship

# Description:

Project-Battleship or Frigate is a command-line-based game written in C++ where players take on the role of a naval commander hunting down enemy ships hidden on a grid. The objective of the game is to locate and destroy all enemy ships within a specified number of tries (bullets). Players input coordinates to guess the location of enemy ships, and the game provides feedback on whether the guess was a hit or a miss. The game ends when either all enemy ships are destroyed or the player runs out of bullets.

# Features:

* Command-line interface for a nostalgic gaming experience.
* Players specify the location of enemy ships on the grid.
* Guess the coordinates to locate and destroy enemy ships.
* Limited number of tries (bullets) to complete the mission.
